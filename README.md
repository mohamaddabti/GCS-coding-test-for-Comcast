# GCS-coding-test-for-Comcast

Objective
Create a command-line application that interacts with the OpenWeather API to manage weather
details of cities. The requirements of what the application should allow the user to do are below.

Requirements
1. Search for Weather Details of a City: Enter the name of a city and display its current weather details
using the OpenWeather API.
2. Add a City to Favourites: Allow users to add a city to their list of favourites, with a maximum of three
cities.
3. List Favourite Cities: Display the list of favourite cities along with their current weather details.
4. Update Favourite Cities: Enable users to remove a city from their favourites and add a new one,
ensuring the limit of three cities at a time.

Information
1. Use any programming language you are comfortable with.
2. Implement functionalities to interact with the OpenWeather API.
3. Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
4. Store the favourite cities in memory.
5. Push your code to a GitHub repository and share the link with your recruitment consultant.

Criteria
1. API Integration: Effectiveness in integrating and using the OpenWeather API.
2. Code Efficiency and Quality: How well does the application perform its tasks, and is the code
maintainable?
3. Problem-Solving Approach: Strategies used for managing favourites and handling API responses.

Activity 2 -
Pseudocode

to code

Objective
Below is a pseudocode for a more complex algorithm. Your task is to convert it into a working
program in any programming language of your choice. The program should perform the exact
function described in the pseudocode.

Approx 30 mins

FUNCTION sortAndFindMedian(numbers)
CALL sort(numbers)
DEFINE n AS length of numbers
IF n MOD 2 = 0
RETURN (numbers[n/2 - 1] + numbers[n/2 ) / 2
ELSE
RETURN numbers[n/2]
ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION sort(numbers)
// Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, etc.)
// Sort the 'numbers' array in ascending order
// Pseudocode for the sorting algorithm is not provided; implement as per your
understanding
ENDFUNCTION

Requirements
1. Implement the sortAndFindMedian function in a language you are comfortable with.
2. You need to implement a sorting algorithm as part of the sort function. Choose any
sorting algorithm you are familiar with.
3. The program should output the median of an array of numbers.
4. Provide a simple user interface for inputting the array of numbers or use predefined
test cases.
5. Push your code to a GitHub repository and share the link.

Information
1. Use any programming language you are comfortable with.
2. Write clean, readable code.
3. Push your code to a GitHub repository and share the link with your recruitment
consultant.

Criteria
1. Algorithm Implementation - accuracy in translating the pseudocode into a working
program and correctly implementing the sorting algorithm.
2. Code Quality - is the code well-structured, efficient, and readable?
3. Problem-Solving Approach - how are inputs handled, and how efficiently is the
median calculated?
